# 🧭 SmartArtHub – Step-by-Step Development Guide

This document outlines the exact steps to take your SmartArtHub stub project and evolve it into a full, cloud-deployed, AI-powered portfolio project.

---

## ✅ 1. Open the Project Locally
- Unzip `SmartArtHub_Complete_Project.zip`
- Open in your preferred IDE:
  - **Backend**: IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code
  - **Frontend**: VS Code or WebStorm

---

## 🔨 2. Set Up the Backend (Spring Boot)
- Create Maven/Gradle project structures for each service:
  - `user-service`
  - `artwork-service`
  - `feedback-service`
- Add:
  - Controllers, Services, and Repositories
  - Spring Boot starter dependencies
- Implement core logic:
  - Upload to S3 (artwork-service)
  - Store metadata (MongoDB/Postgres)
  - Call Claude/OpenAI (feedback-service)

---

## 🌐 3. Set Up the Frontend (Angular)
- Navigate to the frontend folder
- If needed, create an Angular app:
  ```bash
  ng new smartarthub --routing --style=css
  ```
- Copy over `upload.component.ts` and `upload.component.html`
- Serve locally:
  ```bash
  ng serve
  ```

---

## ☁️ 4. Set Up AWS Services
- Create an S3 bucket to store images
- Configure IAM roles/policies
- Choose a deployment path:
  - **ECS Fargate** (preferred for microservices)
  - **EC2** for VM-based deployment
  - **Elastic Beanstalk** for simplified management

---

## 🔁 5. Wire the Full Application Flow
- Angular frontend → Spring Boot API (artwork-service)
- Upload image → Store in S3
- Feedback service sends request to Claude/OpenAI → Gets analysis
- Return feedback → Display in Angular UI

---

## ⚙️ 6. Add CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Use existing `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- Extend to:
  - Build Docker images
  - Push to AWS ECR
  - Deploy to ECS or EC2
- Automate deployment on push to `main` branch

---

## 🧪 7. Test and Iterate
- Use Postman or curl for API testing
- Validate local and deployed environments
- Fix integration issues across services
- Test end-to-end feedback loop (upload → AI response → UI)

---

## 🎯 8. Polish and Publish
- Add architecture diagram (Lucidchart, Draw.io)
- Finalize README with:
  - Features
  - Stack
  - Deployment notes
- Push to GitHub
- Share project on LinkedIn and GitHub as part of your portfolio
- (Optional) Record a walkthrough demo video

---

## 🏁 Result
A fully functional, production-style, AI-powered cloud app — perfect for showcasing your transition to **Cloud Solutions Architect**.
