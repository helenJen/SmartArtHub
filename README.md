## üß≠ Architecture
```
Angular ‚Üî API Gateway ‚Üî Spring Boot Microservices
               ‚Üò AWS S3 (Image Storage)
               ‚Üò Claude/OpenAI (AI Feedback)
               ‚Üò MongoDB/Redis (Metadata Cache)
```

## üì¶ Microservices Overview
- `user-service`: Handles user profiles and settings
- `artwork-service`: Manages image uploads, S3 storage, metadata
- `feedback-service`: Connects to Claude/OpenAI to analyze art

---

## üß† Claude/OpenAI Integration
Feedback service sends:
```json
{
  "imageUrl": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/your-bucket/art1.jpg",
  "title": "Morning Mist"
}
```
And receives:
```json
"The composition is well-balanced, with a calm use of color and a soft atmospheric effect. Consider highlighting contrast near the focal point."
```

You can connect to:
- **Claude** via API Gateway or Bedrock (AWS)
- **OpenAI** via `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`

Prompt template:
```
Analyze this artwork and provide creative feedback:
Title: {{title}}
URL: {{imageUrl}}

Focus on color use, composition, emotion, and style.
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD with GitHub Actions
Sample Workflow:
```yaml
name: Build and Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up JDK
        uses: actions/setup-java@v3
        with:
          java-version: '17'
          distribution: 'temurin'
      - name: Build
        run: mvn clean install
```

Add Docker build + push and ECS deployment stages as needed.

---

## üê≥ Docker + ECS Deployment
### Backend
- Build Docker images for each service
- Push to AWS ECR
- Deploy via ECS Fargate

### Frontend
- Use NGINX container or deploy to S3 (static site hosting)
